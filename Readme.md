# 2css

Similar to atomic CSS frameworks like Tachyons and TailwindCSS, 2css aims to reduce every css property to just 2 letters while still reading (in your mind) as through you're writing css rules, to reduce the memory burden when switching between frontend frameworks.

The css rules are generated by a PHP script which expects some naming conventions, then outputs a file with all the CSS classes.

Thanks to tools such as PurgeCss this project throws just about every combination of rule and scale into the mix to be stripped out later.

The benefits are faster development, less context switching and less need for cache busting, longer term the frontend styling will be more maintainable. 

The downsides are additional steps required to strip out unneeded code, inflated html content and the need to strictly enfore class usage site wide.

The effects section governing animation and transitions is a bit ropey, however it's simple enough to use the excellent [Animate.css](https://animate.style) library instead.
