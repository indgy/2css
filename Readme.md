# 2css

A modern complement to atomic CSS frameworks like Tachyons and TailwindCSS

This is a very early stage project, the idea was to create a utility first css language using the minimum amount of characters while still reading (in your mind) as through you're writing css rules.

It is similar in concept to Tachyons, but thanks to new tools such as PurgeCss this project throws just about every combination of rule and scale into the mix to be stripped out later.

The benefits are faster development, less context switching and less need for cache busting, longer term the frontend styling will be more maintainable. 

The effects section governing animation and transitions is a bit ropey, however it's simple enough to use the excellent [Animate.css](https://animate.style) library instead.
